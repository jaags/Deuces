Deuces version 1.0 pre-alpha

The game is now working, but in a very crude form.
The next step is to take the code in Deuces.py, and split it 
between a server and a client app for the players to connect 
and play with each other.

==Deuces.py==
Working game logic, requires four players, passing 
around the keyboard taking their turn
UI is text-based

==Deuces_Serv.py==
The server code, will contain all the game logic,
receiving the player's commands from the client and
serving the client the game's state as it changes

==Deuces_txtclient.py==
The client, displays the UI based on the game's state,
accepts and sends user commands to the server.
Text based UI

Thus begins a new era: the day mankind set forth to play Big Two...online

For His/Her Majesty, The Quang of Quangs!
